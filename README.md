# Djashboard

Django web app to display as many jumbotron alert widgets on the same dashboard as you define in a json config file.
The starting case is air quality from a training video I watched, but I abstracted it to an engine.
Code is almost unrecognizable from its starting place, but I am using the same API call in my business logic json config script for the dashboard widgets.
